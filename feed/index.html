				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27" src="http://www.possothespat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Teach-Children-Value-of-Money-300x200.jpg" alt="teach-children-value-of-money" width="500" height="334" srcset="http://www.possothespat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Teach-Children-Value-of-Money-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.possothespat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Teach-Children-Value-of-Money.jpg 458w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In these days and times, families have more spending power as both parents work. As a result, they have bigger aspirations of familyâs lifestyle. Also working parents tend to indulge their children out of guilt of not being able to spend more time, as psychologists point out that. In fact, a large market segment targets<span id="more-25"></span> on such families. Advertisements of FMCG (Fast Moving Consumer Goods) products like toothpaste, jams, cornflakes, juice are aimed at children, who in turn decide what comes home â Close Up or Anchor!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, here the question isnât whether children should be participative for making the grocery list or not. In fact, sometimes it can be a good thing.Â The actual debate is whether the power to spend money at such a young age can sow the seeds of spendthrift behaviour.Â Letâs understand what spendthrift behaviour means. Clinical psychologist Seema Hingorrany defines it as spending of money recklessly for instant gratification.Â So, this means that people, whether adults or children, tend to veer towards compulsive shopping. It could be more gadgets, toys, expensive stationery, anything.<br />
If you do not supervise your <a href="http://www.kidspot.com.au/lifestyle/career-and-money/budgeting/teach-kids-how-to-spend-money">kidâs spending</a> or give in to their every demand, they may then insist on you buying them things all the time. Says clinical psychologist Varkha Chulani, âThey tend to spend give little thought for savings.âÂ Of course, once in a while, especially on occasions like birthday, festivals, or a good report card, you can indulge your children to a fancy stationery, expensive chocolates, latest toys or whatever they like. But also teach them to save.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-26" src="http://www.possothespat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/1-300x222.jpg" alt="1" width="500" height="370" srcset="http://www.possothespat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/1-300x222.jpg 300w, http://www.possothespat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/1-768x569.jpg 768w, http://www.possothespat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/1-1024x759.jpg 1024w, http://www.possothespat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/1.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><br />
Hereâs howâ¦<br />
1. First, buy them a piggy bank of their choice. Or better still, involve them and make one at home. Just the simple fact that they own something completely will encourage them to keep filling the box.<br />
2. If your child wants something thatâs not a necessity, for eg: a toy, find out its price. And tell them that you will give a portion of the money, and the rest, they can save.<br />
3. Also, be fair with your children by giving a decent amount of pocket money, so that they can save some too.<br />
4. You can try this exercise too. If you buy junk food for your kid everyday, sometimes give them a choice if they want a packet of chips or Rs 10.<br />
5. As soon as you can, open a juniorâs account in your bank for your child. Theyâll be able to understand better about savings and may not to save more to see something in their account.<br />
6. If your child manages to save a decently big amount, reward them sometimes by adding some more money to it.<br />
7. Praise their saving habits too.<br />
8. Allow them to occasionally shop with you. Teach them to compare prices of different products.<br />
9. Teach them to write down in a diary the amount they spend.<br />
10. Make them earn extra money. For eg: During summer vacations, you can ask your child to wash your car or bike and pay them. Or take them along with you for grocery shopping to help you carry some bags, or ask them to iron your shirt, and pay them some money for their efforts.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-22" src="http://www.possothespat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Northern-Kentucky-Newborn-Photographer-18-300x200.jpg" alt="northern-kentucky-newborn-photographer-18" width="500" height="334" srcset="http://www.possothespat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Northern-Kentucky-Newborn-Photographer-18-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.possothespat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Northern-Kentucky-Newborn-Photographer-18-768x513.jpg 768w, http://www.possothespat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Northern-Kentucky-Newborn-Photographer-18.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>Parenthood changes the world. You promise to give the best to your baby, your tiny bundle of joy and nurture them â their body, mind and soul. Every parent, especially those for whom itâs the first time, is very concerned about the health and proper growth of their child. They know that a child needs a balanced diet for the sake of nutrients and energy needed<span id="more-21"></span> for growth that essentially includes protein, calcium, iron, <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/0_vitamin-a-in-your-childs-diet_10324693.bc">vitamin A</a>, vitamin C, and thiamine, but what are the exact sources and how to ensure that each important element is present in their childâs diet is a big question?<br />
Nutritionist Dr Nupur Krishnan of Bio-Logics Health, Mumbai spells out dietary requirements for your baby. Read on:<br />
<strong>* 0 â 4 months: Breast Milk</strong></p>
<p>Motherâs milk provides the primary source of nutrition for newborns before they are able to eat and digest other foods. For the first few days after delivery, breasts produce milk that is thin, watery, and sweet. This quenches the babyâs thirst and provides the proteins, sugar, and minerals the baby needs. Over time the milk changes and becomes thick and creamy. This satisfies the babyâs hunger. After the child has completed 4 months, the mother can start giving him/her different variety of foods (weaning foods). But along with these foods, breast milk must be continued up to one and half year.</p>
<p><strong>* 4 â 6 months: Start with mashed banana and purees</strong></p>
<p>Food stuff you can introduce your child to are:<br />
&#8211; Thin porridge, from wheat flour, ground rice etc, mixed with milk and vegetable oil<br />
&#8211; Lime juice<br />
&#8211; Fruit juice (add little sugar)<br />
&#8211; Green leafy vegetables (soup in milk)<br />
&#8211; Suji Kheer<br />
&#8211; Dal water (moong dal + oil/ pure ghee).</p>
<p><strong>* 6 â 9 months: Mash things up</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I was reflecting the other day how much pregnancy has become a specialized industry, with its own collection of pillows, clothes, and âremediesâ. But like many things, a lot of these specialized products are not really necessary, which is why they are relatively new. So what is necessary? What should you really invest in to make pregnancy easier for you, and what can you do without? Hereâs a quick list<span id="more-16"></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. PRENATAL VITAMINS Day By Day Pregnancy: The Must Have Pregnancy List: Good health for you and your baby is necessary. You donât have to buy some super-fancy brand or special kind of prenatal vitamins. Just get a list from your doctor of what the latest recommendations are for what a good <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/0_prenatal-vitamins-why-theyre-so-important_287.bc">prenatal vitamin</a> Day By Day Pregnancy: The Must Have Pregnancy List should have, and stick with one that has those ingredients and amounts (they change often). My personal favorite? Since my pregnancies always come with severe morning sickness, I found the only vitamin appealing to me is the childâs Flintstones chewables I ate as a kid. I still love them, and even when sick, will take them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. BIGGER CLOTHES: You will need bigger clothes. You do not necessarily need maternity clothes. In fact, the style of clothes nowadays almost makes maternity wear obsolete. Wrap dresses, long shirts, big sweaters, knit and stretchy pants â all of these styles hide a pregnancy well into the last trimester. Itâs a much better financial investment to buy clothes in a size or two larger than your normal size than to get something specific to pregnancy. If you work in a formal office you might have to make more changes, but unless you need a fitted pantsuit every day, you can get away with a lot of larger sizes until the very end.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17" src="http://www.possothespat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fotolia_64539513_Subscription_Monthly_M1-550x366-300x200.jpg" alt="fotolia_64539513_subscription_monthly_m1-550x366" width="500" height="333" srcset="http://www.possothespat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fotolia_64539513_Subscription_Monthly_M1-550x366-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.possothespat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fotolia_64539513_Subscription_Monthly_M1-550x366.jpg 550w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3. GOOD FOOD, SMALL PORTIONS: More than belly bands or pregnancy necklaces, you need healthy, simple food that doesnât make you sick to your stomach or uncomfortable in other ways, and you need this food in small portions. Make it easy on yourself by reevaluating the way you shop for food, and keep a list of things that start to work for you (new flavors of yogurt, cheese sticks, crackers). Also, invest in ziploc bags of several sizes and small tupperware Day By Day Pregnancy: The Must Have Pregnancy List containers. Make it easy on yourself to eat well and eat right.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4. BIGGER UNDERGARMENTS: Oh yes, such fun. Bigger bras and bigger underwear are going to be necessary at some point in your pregnancy, so prepare yourself and your budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5. A COMFORTABLE SLEEP: Sleep is everything when you are pregnant, if for no other reason than you wonât get any for the first three months after you stop <a href="http://www.parents.com/pregnancy/my-life/emotions/why-i-loved-being-pregnant/">being pregnant</a>. Do what you have to do to make that bed comfortable. If you need extra pillows, a memory foam pillow top (can you tell, perhaps, that I have bought all of these?), a pregnancy pillow Day By Day Pregnancy: The Must Have Pregnancy List, a humidifier Day By Day Pregnancy: The Must Have Pregnancy List, a better comforter, softer sheetsâ¦ You can see where I am going with this. Donât worry about maternity tops, worry about your bed. Make it comfortable, and make it a place where you can sleep as much as possible as long as possible.</p>
